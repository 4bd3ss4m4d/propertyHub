## üìÑ Project Overview

**Property Hub** is a comprehensive real estate web application. It allows users to search for properties based on various criteria, create listings, and manage user profiles. The project is divided into two main parts: the **frontend** (client-side) built with React.js and the **backend** (server-side) built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

The backend API is designed to manage the core real estate functionalities: managing users, properties, agents, and transactions. The API also includes JWT-based authentication and Google OAuth integration.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Dependencies

**Property Hub** leverages a modern and scalable tech stack to ensure optimal performance and seamless user experience. Below is a breakdown of the key technologies and tools used:

### üöÄ Backend:

- **Express.js** - Web framework for Node.js, simplifying the process of building APIs.
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL database providing a flexible, scalable solution for storing property listings, user data, and more.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** - Secure authentication method used for user verification.
- **Passport.js** - Middleware for authentication, integrated with Google OAuth for seamless user sign-in and sign-up.
  
### üåê Frontend:
- **React.js** - A popular JavaScript library for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **Redux** - State management tool to handle complex application states in a predictable way.
- **HTML5** - The backbone for structuring the web pages of the client-side.
- **CSS3** - Modern stylesheets for responsive and visually engaging UI designs.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Core scripting language for adding interactivity to web pages.

### üì¶ DevOps & Utilities:
- **Vite** - Next-generation frontend tooling to serve and build faster React apps.
- **Mongoose** - Elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
- **Jest** - Testing framework used for ensuring the correctness of our codebase.
- **Supertest** - Library for testing Node.js HTTP servers.
- **ESLint** - Linter tool to maintain code quality and consistency.
  
### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous:
- **Git** - Version control system for tracking changes and collaborating on code.
- **Postman** - API client used to test, debug, and document our API endpoints.
- **dotenv** - Environment variable manager to handle sensitive configurations securely.

## üîê Authentication

The authentication system in **Property Hub** includes routes for both local authentication and Google OAuth. These routes allow users, admins, and agents to register, log in, and manage authentication sessions using JWT tokens.

### Authentication Endpoints

#### Google OAuth Authentication

| Method | Endpoint                           | Description                                              |
|--------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/auth/google/signup`          | Initiates the Google OAuth sign-up process.               |
| GET    | `/api/auth/google/signin`          | Initiates the Google OAuth sign-in process.               |
| GET    | `/api/auth/google/signup/callback` | Callback for handling Google OAuth sign-up and token generation. |
| GET    | `/api/auth/google/signin/callback` | Callback for handling Google OAuth sign-in and token generation. |

- **Google OAuth Signup**: After the user authenticates with Google, they will be redirected to the `/signup/success` or `/signup/failure` URL, depending on the result.
- **Google OAuth Signin**: After signing in with Google, users are redirected to `/signin/success` or `/signin/failure`.

#### Local Authentication (Users)

| Method | Endpoint                 | Description                             |
|--------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/auth/signup`        | Registers a new user account.           |
| POST   | `/api/auth/signin`        | Logs in a user and returns a JWT token. |
| POST   | `/api/auth/logout`        | Logs out the current user and clears the JWT cookie. |
| GET    | `/api/auth/check-username/:username` | Checks if a username is available. |
| GET    | `/api/auth/check-email/:email`       | Checks if an email is already registered. |

#### Admin Authentication

| Method | Endpoint                  | Description                             |
|--------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/auth/admins/signup`  | Registers a new admin account (Super Admin only). |
| POST   | `/api/auth/admins/login`   | Logs in an admin and returns a JWT token. |

- **Admin Signup**: Admins are created only by a super admin. JWT tokens are issued upon successful registration.
- **Admin Login**: Admins log in using their credentials and receive a JWT token to authenticate future requests.

#### Agent Authentication

| Method | Endpoint                 | Description                             |
|--------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/auth/agents/signup` | Registers a new agent account.          |
| POST   | `/api/auth/agents/login`  | Logs in an agent and returns a JWT token. |

- **Agent Signup**: Any user can register as an agent, and a JWT token is issued upon successful registration.
- **Agent Login**: Agents log in using their credentials and receive a JWT token to authenticate future requests.

### Token-Based Authentication (JWT)

**JWT (JSON Web Token)** is used for securing endpoints. Upon successful login or sign-up, a JWT token is issued and stored as a cookie on the client side. This token must be included in subsequent requests to authenticate the user.

**Cookie Name**: The JWT token is stored in a cookie named `propertyHubAuthToken`.

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Schema

This section provides a brief overview of the main MongoDB schema models used in **Property Hub**.

### üèòÔ∏è Property Model

The **Property** model represents real estate properties on the platform. It includes details such as:

- `title`, `description`, and `propertyType` ‚Äì basic information about the property.
- `price`, `size`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `rooms` ‚Äì essential property details.
- `address` ‚Äì nested object containing street, city, state, and country.
- `offerType` ‚Äì indicates if the property is for sale or rent.
- `amenities` and `images` ‚Äì optional features and media associated with the property.
- `coordinates` ‚Äì latitude and longitude for geolocation.

This model ensures that each property has the necessary attributes for filtering and viewing.

---

### üë§ User Model

The **User** model manages platform users' information. It includes:

- `firstName`, `lastName`, and `username` ‚Äì personal details for identification.
- `email` and `password` ‚Äì used for authentication and login.
- `avatar` ‚Äì profile picture, with a default placeholder image.
- `properties` ‚Äì references properties owned or managed by the user.
- `role` ‚Äì defines user permissions, defaulting to a regular user role.

Users can register, log in, and manage their real estate listings.

---

### üë®‚Äçüíº Agent Model

The **Agent** model extends from the user model and represents real estate agents. It includes:

- `agency`, `licenseNumber` ‚Äì unique to agents, identifying the agency they work for and their legal license.
- `bio` ‚Äì a short description about the agent.
- `properties` ‚Äì a reference to properties managed by the agent.
- `rating` and `reviewsCount` ‚Äì used to track agent ratings based on customer reviews.
- `agentStatus` ‚Äì tracks if an agent is active, pending, or rejected by the platform admins.

Agents have additional permissions and responsibilities compared to regular users.

---

### üë®‚Äçüíº Admin Model

The **Admin** model manages platform administrators, who have control over users, agents, and platform settings. It includes:

- `role` ‚Äì distinguishes between regular `admin` and `super-admin` with higher permissions.
- `permissions` ‚Äì defines actions each admin can perform, such as managing users, agents, and admins.
- `joinedAt` ‚Äì the date the admin was added to the system.

Admins oversee platform operations and can assign roles to other users or agents.

---

### ‚ùì FAQ Model

The **FAQ** model stores frequently asked questions related to platform usage and general inquiries. It includes:

- `question` ‚Äì the text of the question.
- `answer` ‚Äì the corresponding response.
- `category` ‚Äì to group similar FAQs under a specific topic.
  
This model helps users find answers quickly without needing additional support.
